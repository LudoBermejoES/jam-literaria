# Vote Count Visualization Feature

## Overview

This feature adds vote count visualization to the results screen, showing how many votes each winning idea received throughout all voting rounds.

## What's New

### ðŸŽ¯ Vote Count Display
- **Winner Cards**: Each winning idea now displays the total number of votes it received
- **Accurate Counting**: Votes are counted across all voting rounds (including tiebreaker rounds)
- **Multilingual Support**: Vote counts are displayed in both English ("vote"/"votes") and Spanish ("voto"/"votos")

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

#### Backend Changes

1. **New Vote Model Method** (`server/models/Vote.js`)
   ```javascript
   static getTotalVoteCountsForIdeas(sessionId, ideaIds)
   ```
   - Calculates total votes for specific ideas across all rounds
   - Uses efficient SQL query with IN clause for multiple ideas

2. **Enhanced Vote Service** (`server/services/voteService.js`)
   - Modified `getVoteResults()` function to calculate actual vote counts
   - Replaces previous placeholder `vote_count: 0` with real data
   - Maintains backward compatibility for ongoing sessions

#### Frontend Changes

1. **Results Screen Enhancement** (`app/src/components/ResultsScreen.jsx`)
   - Added vote count display to winner cards
   - Shows vote count with proper singular/plural forms
   - Responsive design for mobile devices

2. **CSS Styling** (`app/src/components/ResultsScreen.css`)
   - New `.vote-count` styles with modern design
   - Responsive layout adjustments
   - Consistent with existing design system

## How It Works

### Vote Counting Logic
1. When a session completes, winning ideas are stored in session metadata
2. The system queries all votes for those specific ideas across all rounds
3. Vote counts are aggregated and returned with the results
4. Frontend displays the total count next to each winning idea

### Data Flow
```
Session Completion â†’ Store Winners â†’ Calculate Total Votes â†’ Display Results
```

### Example Display
```
ðŸ¥‡ Winner Card
"Amazing story idea about time travel"
[Winner] [5 votes] [â€” Author Name]
```
