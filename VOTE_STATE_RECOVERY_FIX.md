# Vote State Recovery Fix

## Problem Fixed
**Critical Issue**: Vote State Recovery Failure - Users could accidentally vote multiple times after browser refresh, compromising voting integrity.

## Root Cause
- Client-side voting state (`hasVoted`, `selectedIdeas`) was lost on browser refresh
- No server-side validation to prevent duplicate voting
- No mechanism to recover user's voting status from server

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Server-Side Duplicate Vote Prevention
**File**: `server/socket/voteHandlers.js`

Added validation in both `submit-votes` and `submit-vote` handlers:
```javascript
// Check if user has already voted in this round
const hasAlreadyVoted = Vote.hasUserVotedInRound(socket.userId, sessionId, session.current_round);

if (hasAlreadyVoted) {
  socket.emit('error', { 
    message: 'You have already voted in this round. Refresh the page to see your current voting status.' 
  });
  return;
}
```

### 2. Vote Status Recovery API
**File**: `server/socket/voteHandlers.js`

Added new socket event `get-user-vote-status` that returns:
- Whether user has voted in current round
- List of ideas the user voted for (for display)
- Required votes for current round
- Full session and access validation

```javascript
socket.emit('user-vote-status', {
  sessionId,
  round: session.current_round,
  hasVoted,
  userVotes: userVotes.map(vote => ({
    ideaId: vote.idea_id,
    ideaContent: vote.idea_content
  })),
  requiredVotes
});
```

### 3. Client-Side State Recovery
**File**: `app/src/components/VotingScreen.jsx`

#### On Component Mount:
- Automatically requests user's voting status: `socket.emit('get-user-vote-status', { sessionId })`

#### State Recovery Handling:
```javascript
socket.on('user-vote-status', (data) => {
  if (data.hasVoted) {
    setHasVoted(true);
    // Recover selected ideas
    const votedIdeaIds = new Set(data.userVotes.map(vote => vote.ideaId));
    setSelectedIdeas(votedIdeaIds);
  } else {
    setHasVoted(false);
    setSelectedIdeas(new Set());
  }
  setRequiredVotes(data.requiredVotes);
});
```

#### Enhanced Voted State Display:
Shows user's previously selected ideas with confirmation:
```javascript
{selectedIdeas.size > 0 && (
  <div className="selected-ideas-summary">
    <h3>Your Selected Ideas:</h3>
    {/* Display voted ideas with ✓ Selected badges */}
  </div>
)}
```

### 4. Additional Safety Measures

#### New Round Vote Status Check:
When new voting rounds start, automatically re-check vote status:
```javascript
socket.on('new-voting-round', (data) => {
  // ... handle new round ...
  socket.emit('get-user-vote-status', { sessionId });
});
```

#### Enhanced CSS Styling:
Added styles for selected ideas summary in voted state to clearly show user's choices.

## Browser Refresh Scenario - FIXED

### Before Fix:
1. User selects ideas and refreshes browser ❌
2. `hasVoted` resets to `false` ❌
3. `selectedIdeas` becomes empty ❌
4. User can vote again ❌
5. Vote counting becomes corrupted ❌

### After Fix:
1. User selects ideas and refreshes browser ✅
2. Component mounts and requests vote status ✅
3. Server returns voting state (hasVoted=true, userVotes=[...]) ✅
4. Client recovers state and shows "Vote Submitted!" with selections ✅
5. If user tries to vote again, server prevents duplicate ✅
6. Vote integrity maintained ✅

## Security Improvements

1. **Server-Side Validation**: Prevents client-side manipulation
2. **Session Access Validation**: Re-validates user access before returning vote status
3. **Round-Specific Checks**: Ensures votes are tracked per voting round
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: Database constraints + application logic prevent double voting

## Database Utilization

Leveraged existing Vote model methods:
- `Vote.hasUserVotedInRound(userId, sessionId, round)` - Check if voted
- `Vote.getVotesByUserSessionAndRound(userId, sessionId, round)` - Get user's votes
- Existing UNIQUE constraint: `UNIQUE (user_id, idea_id, round, session_id)`

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Refresh During Voting
1. User selects 3 ideas
2. Refreshes browser
3. ✅ Page loads with "Vote Submitted!" state
4. ✅ Shows previously selected ideas
5. ✅ Cannot vote again

### Scenario 2: Refresh After Voting
1. User has already voted
2. Refreshes browser
3. ✅ Immediately shows voted state
4. ✅ Displays selected ideas
5. ✅ Server prevents duplicate votes

### Scenario 3: Multiple Rounds
1. User votes in Round 1
2. New round starts (tie-breaker)
3. ✅ Voting state resets for new round
4. ✅ User can vote in new round
5. ✅ Each round tracked independently

## Impact

✅ **Vote Integrity**: No more duplicate voting  
✅ **User Experience**: Seamless browser refresh recovery  
✅ **Security**: Server-side validation prevents manipulation  
✅ **Transparency**: Users see their voting choices clearly  
✅ **Reliability**: Robust state management across disconnections  

This fix addresses the #1 critical vulnerability identified in the session management analysis and ensures the democratic voting process remains fair and reliable.

## Additional Fix: Context-Aware Ideas Display

### Problem Found During Testing
After implementing vote state recovery, a new issue was discovered:
- **First screen**: Correctly showed 4 candidate ideas in tie-breaker round
- **After refresh**: Incorrectly showed all 8 session ideas instead of 4 candidates

### Root Cause
The `get-ideas` socket handler was not context-aware:
```javascript
// Before: Always returned ALL session ideas
const ideas = ideaService.getIdeasBySessionId(sessionId);
```

### Solution
**File**: `server/socket/ideaHandlers.js`

Made `get-ideas` handler context-aware based on session status:
```javascript
if (session.status === SESSION_STATUS.VOTING) {
  // In voting phase, return candidate ideas for current round
  ideas = ideaService.getCandidateIdeasForVoting(sessionId);
} else {
  // In other phases, return all session ideas  
  ideas = ideaService.getIdeasBySessionId(sessionId);
}
```

### How `getCandidateIdeasForVoting` Works
1. **Tie-breaker rounds**: Returns only `ideas_candidatas` from session metadata
2. **First round**: Returns all session ideas
3. **Context-aware**: Respects current voting round state

### Browser Refresh - Tie-breaker Round - FIXED

#### Before Fix:
1. Tie-breaker round shows 4 candidates ✅
2. User refreshes browser ❌
3. Shows all 8 session ideas ❌
4. User confused about which ideas to vote for ❌

#### After Fix:
1. Tie-breaker round shows 4 candidates ✅
2. User refreshes browser ✅
3. Still shows only 4 candidate ideas ✅
4. Correct voting context maintained ✅

### Enhanced Logging
Added comprehensive logging for debugging:
- Server: `Returning X candidate ideas for voting`
- Client: `Received X ideas for session, round Y, status: VOTING`

This ensures the correct ideas are displayed based on the current voting round context, maintaining the integrity of tie-breaker rounds after browser refresh.
